    <h2>A boring lecture about HTML and Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HTML</strong> is a coding language used in web browsers to create websites.
      Knowing how to write and read HTML is a useful ability for any aspiring web developers, as it is a very fundamental tool in that line of work.
    </p>

  <div class="main">
    <h2>What is HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is a coding language used to structure and layout content on webpages.
      HTML is used in every website you've probably ever visited, even this uses HTML!
      Learning most coding languages is like learning an entirely new language, <em>it takes time!</em> HTML is no different.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
    <p>
      I wouldn't learn HTML from a small document on github made by a student, there are plenty of courses you can take from experienced programmers.
      Some of the most important HTML elements I have learned include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>p, or paragraph, represents the start of a paragraph.</li>
      <li>h, or header, represents a 'header'. It's hard to explain in a small space, so here's an <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/what-are-h-tags-how-headings-affect-user-experience">interesting page</a> that explains it well.</li>
      <li>ul, ol, and li representing Unordered List, Ordered List, and List Item respectively. This list is a UL, an OL would have numbers instead of dots.</li>
      <li>a, or Anchor Tag, is used to link something from a webpage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are many other interesting tags in HTML, but it would take a long time to talk about each one individually!
      Every single document written in HTML should define that the document is HTML for the webpage, which is invisible when viewing the page. Check the top of the document, you can't see it on the webpage but it's there!
      Another important part of HTML is a head, which usually includes important information such as document title.
      Of course though, the body is also an important part! All things that appear on a webpage are nested in the body tag.
    </p>
    <h2>CSS and Styles</h2>
    <p>
      You may realize, this webpage looks very different from others. Most webpages use the same coding language, so why do they all look so different?
      This is where CSS comes in! This document is about HTML, so this explanation will be short.
      CSS is used to stylize a document, and can be seen being linked at the top of the document. CSS is extremely important, but not required.
      If you want a website to look unique and not like a black and white blob, it's recommended to learn how to use CSS. It's just about as important as HTML is!
      Here's a website known as the <a href="https://csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> showing multiple great examples as to how well CSS can reshape a page!
    </p>
    <h2>Usage of HTML in Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is important in web development! As said previously, every website you've visited uses it.
      HTML is the <em>backbone of web development</em>. If you're looking for a web development job, you're going to want to know it!
      Of course, there are certain tools that can simplify webpage creation into nearly not requiring prior knowledge in HTML, but there will always be limitations.
    </p>
    <h2>Will AI replace Web Developers?</h2>
    <p>
      Short answer? It's not very likely.
      AI can be made smarter and smarter, and could in theory replace the jobs of anyone. This is a given. However, every job would still require human input as AI is flawed.
      A lot of people undermine how difficult web development can be. There's so many factors to take into account, and it's not nearly as easy as most people think it is.
      On top of this, AI can not think like a person. It's just code running on prior knowledge, it doesn't see things the way people do. A website made by AI won't look nearly as good as one made by a person.
      While AI can use its previous experiences and try and make something new, it lacks something that humans have plenty of: creativity.
      You might've heard, but true randomness can't be made using computers. In the end, computers follow fact. This means that AI can't be like a person in terms of creativity.
      On top of this, AI can find it hard to patch out certain issues or adapt to changes in the field. AI can be used to help web developers, but replace them? Unlikely.

  <div class="start">
    <h2>How should I start?</h2>
    <p>
      Want to learn HTML? Great! There's plenty of ways to start, and it's never really too late to get started!
      While learning on your own and trying to figure things out is a way to do it, I still do recommend finding an instructor or class of some sort.
      Remember, it's not an issue having to ask questions or look things up. Nobody will be mad if you don't know everything, nobody is perfect after all.
      On top of the previous line, a lot of web development in companies is done in teams. If you excel in one place but struggle in another, someone in your team can help. Even on the field, you're bound to learn more and more!
      Of course, there are bound to be jobs where you're alone. Things happen. You'll have to adapt, which can be difficult. But sometimes, that's life. It's bound to happen in all sorts of jobs.
      The only way to know if it's the right path for you is to try it out. If you don't like it, or the work isn't what you're looking for, it's alright to move on.
      Good luck!
